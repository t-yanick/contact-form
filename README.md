You are contributing contribute the code back to the official coolapp repo, but you realize there is a really dumb typo in one of your source code comments (not commit messages) in commit M. You'd still like to submit the pull request as two commits M' and N', where M' is the fixed version of M, and N' is the same exact diff as N. How do you rewrite git history to make this happen?
Is N' the same hash as N? Why or why not?
